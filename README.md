Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! This repository serves as my personal collection of notes, code snippets, and resources as I follow along with the Kunal Kushwaha DevOps Bootcamp playlist. The journey of mastering DevOps principles and practices is an exciting one, and this repository will help me organize my learnings and share them with others.

## About the DevOps Bootcamp

The DevOps Bootcamp by Kunal Kushwaha is a comprehensive video series that covers various DevOps tools and practices. The goal of this repository is to document what I've learned from the bootcamp and include any code, configurations, and notes that are relevant to the topics covered.

## Learning Progress
